<h3>Spiderman Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>This is one of Josh's favorite movies because he is black, period. And all of his powers are cool.</p>

<h3>How Stella Got Her Groove Back</h3>
<p>This is one of Mama's Favorite Movies because Tae Diggs was looking real fine and this brings back memories of my childhood.</p>
